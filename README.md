With L2 solutions allowing scaling gasless transactions should be accessible by anyone without having to pay any funds to a provider. On top of this it should allow you to scale without rate limits. Self hosting relay solutions allow this and building it for everyone to use for free will allow mass adoption on these L2.

- estimate transactions 
- use different authentications modals to self host these wallets
- much more 

lets see how this goes will work on it for the next month or so.
